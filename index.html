        <p>The RajaSaab (titled onscreen as Prabhas's The RajaSaab) is a 2026 Indian Telugu-language fantasy horror comedy film[7]
        written and directed by Maruthi, and produced by People Media Factory and IVY Entertainment.[8] The film stars Prabhas,
        alongside Sanjay Dutt, Nidhhi Agerwal, Malavika Mohanan (in her Telugu film debut), Riddhi Kumar and Zarina
        Wahab.[9][10] In the film, a man searching for his missing grandfather finds himself in a mansion inhabited by a
        sinister presence.
        
        The project was officially announced in January 2024, though principal photography began earlier in October 2022.[11]
        The film's music is composed by Thaman S, with cinematography by Karthik Palani and editing by Kotagiri Venkateswara
        Rao.[12]
        
        The film was theatrically released worldwide on 9 January 2026, coinciding with Sankranti. It opened to generally
        negative reviews from critics, with criticism directed primarily at the screenplay and runtime, which reviewers found to
        be inconsistent and lacking in narrative cohesion. Despite the festive release window, the film underperformed
        commercially and was classified as a box office failure.[13][14]</p>

<pre>Pawan Kalyan’s New Movie & Recent Film Career (2025-26)

Pawan Kalyan — popularly known as Power Star — is one of Telugu cinema’s most iconic actors, known for his intense
screen presence, charismatic dialogue delivery, and mass appeal. After focusing heavily on his political career in
recent years — including serving as Deputy Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh — fans were unsure if he would continue his
film journey. However, in early 2026 he surprised everyone by officially announcing a new movie project, showing his
continued commitment to cinema alongside politics.

New Film Announcement (2026)

In a major update for fans, Pawan Kalyan signed a new film with director Surender Reddy, a filmmaker known for his
commercial action entertainers. The announcement was made by producer Ram Talluri on social media, marking the beginning
of a fresh cinematic chapter for the actor in 2026. Writer Vakkantham Vamsi is reported to be penning the script, and
this collaboration is generating strong excitement among audiences, as it brings together big commercial talent in
Tollywood.

Details about the story, title, cast, and release window are still under wraps, but this project is seen as a major
comeback for Pawan Kalyan as a leading star after balancing his political responsibilities. Fans have been waiting to
see how he manages the demands of both politics and cinema, and this new film seems to signal that he is committed to
delivering fresh entertainment.

Recent Releases and Upcoming Films

Before this new 2026 announcement, Pawan Kalyan had several films in different stages of production or release:

1. They Call Him OG (2025):

One of the most anticipated films in his recent career was They Call Him OG, directed by Sujeeth and produced by DVV
Entertainment. The movie was scheduled for a worldwide theatrical release on 25 September 2025 in multiple languages
(Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, and Hindi), making it a potential pan-Indian crowd-puller. In the film, Pawan
portrays a gritty gangster character named Ojas Gambheera (nicknamed OG).</pre>
